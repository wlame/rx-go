## [Unreleased]

### Security

- Webhook dispatch no longer follows redirects. A hook target that
  answers `3xx` cannot steer the request at a host that never passed
  validation; the hop is logged and the hook counts as a failure.
- The viewer-bundle downloader re-checks every redirect hop against the
  same address policy, so a redirect to a loopback, link-local, private
  or CGNAT address aborts the download.
- Hook URLs carrying credentials (`http://user:pass@host/`) are
  rejected, in the HTTP layer and on the command line.
- `rx serve` refuses to start when `RX_HOOK_ON_FILE_URL`,
  `RX_HOOK_ON_MATCH_URL` or `RX_HOOK_ON_COMPLETE_URL` points somewhere
  the SSRF guard blocks.
- `rx trace --hook-on-file/--hook-on-match/--hook-on-complete` validate
  their URLs with the same guard the HTTP layer uses.

### Fixed

- The compress output path is now validated against the search roots.
  `POST /v1/compress` answers `403` for an `output_path` outside
  `--search-root`, including one reached through a symlink and including
  `force=true`, and `rx compress` refuses `--output` / `--output-dir`
  destinations outside the roots.
- The compress task now reports `compression_ratio` as
  `decompressed / compressed`, the direction its own API documentation and
  both CLIs already use.
